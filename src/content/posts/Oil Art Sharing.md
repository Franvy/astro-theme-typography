About the artwork

> In "Early Morning After a Storm at Sea," Homer captures the tumultuous yet subsiding energy of the ocean as it calms from a recent storm. This scene likely features the vast expanse of the sea under the early morning light, with waves still showing the remnants of the storm's force but beginning to soften as the day begins. The sky, possibly clearing, may show the warm hues of sunrise filtering through the clouds, suggesting a renewal after the chaos of the storm.

> Oil on card. 27 x 25 cm.
